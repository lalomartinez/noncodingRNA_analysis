### NR2 Database Files
Before running the search scripts, download the required FASTA files from one of the following sources:
- [NR2 Database Website](https://nr2.ncrnadatabases.org/)
- [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jK6SnMpPLwzAxVOMBfW2Z7wR8-6EBd8b/view?usp=drive_link)

Ensure the files are properly downloaded and accessible for the scripts to function correctly.

The repository aims to support bioinformatics workflows, integrating various tools and methods for comprehensive noncoding RNA studies. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

All fasta files will be saved in the bin subfolder
