# noncodingRNA_analysis
This repository is dedicated to storing scripts and tools for the analysis of noncoding RNAs. 
The main objectives include:

- Prediction in Genomic Data: Scripts for identifying and annotating noncoding RNAs in genomic sequences.
- Differential Expression Analysis: Tools for analyzing differential expression of noncoding RNAs from transcriptomic datasets.
-Co-expression Analysis: Pipelines for exploring co-expression networks involving noncoding RNAs.


The repository aims to support bioinformatics workflows, integrating various tools and methods for comprehensive noncoding RNA studies. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
